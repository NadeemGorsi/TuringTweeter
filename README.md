#  Frontend Code Challenge

## Setup

Install the project dependencies:

`npm install`

Install client side dependencies:

`npm run client-install`

Update config.json with your Twitter API credentials.

## Running

Start the static and proxy servers:

`npm start`

to start react based client

`npm run client`

This server will help you to get Twitter's API to send you tweets without you needing to do any authentication.  You don't need to modify server.js at all.


## For Running concurrently

`npm run dev`

Running both server and react app concurrently.
